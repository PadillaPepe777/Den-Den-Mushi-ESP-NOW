I have divided the previously shown electronic schematics in 2 different boards in order to make everything fit inside the snail enclosure
and I chose to have them made by JLCPCB due to their economic price and because I have already sent lots of different projects to them
so I know I can rely on them for this kind of jobs

The 3D models I designed them in SolidWorks, and made the G code in the Cura slicer, for my 3D printer 
Anycubic Kobra 2 Neo, I didn't use blender or related programs because I have 0 experience with them, but I would be 
happy to submit an improved version in the future with someone's help

Looking forward to uploading a 2nd version afer assembling and reviewing my first prototype

Will be submitting instructions in the assembly process in the future
