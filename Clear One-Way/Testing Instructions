This program was tested to achieve clear one-way communication, only going from Sender to Receiver constantly from the moment it's turned on. 
You can experiment with the frequency and bit depth (16 or 32 bits; these must be the same for both microphone and speaker), bytes sent, and the low-pass filter.
However, these are the values ​​that worked best for me after several tests.
