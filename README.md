# Den-Den-Mushi-ESP-NOW
This is a project to develop a Walkie-Talkie Based on the Den Den Mushi Snail Cellphones from One Piece
The things required for this project are obviously for it to function as a common Walkie Talkie would, 
but using the ESP NOW protocol for it's simplicity. Here we could call it a day and just put in in a 
case that reseambles a Den Den Mushi, but the goal is for it to feel "Alive"

The Snail must open and close its eyes as if it was blinking, this with the help of a 
simple mechanism and Servo motor. Apart from this, it needs to open and close the mouth as
it's reproducing the audio from the call

Materials:
ESP32 WROOM 38 pins (should work with other models)

INMP441 I2S Microphone ADC

PCM5102A I2S DAC
(Must have solder in the joints as shown in the nest image)
