For the 1st version of the 3D model I am going very basic, doing a solid works assembly to keep everything in one place
It looks very simple since this is a job that should be made with a tool like Blender or something, and I also need some practice with my 3D modeling skills
This is something to re-work in the future, help is gladly accepted!
